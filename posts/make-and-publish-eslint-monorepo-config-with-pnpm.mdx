excerpt: How to make an ESLint config in a monorepo structure and publish it with pnpm.
---

In this article, we will create an ESLint config using a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) structure. Use the packages inside our repository with [workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as dependencies. And finally, publish those packages to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) repository.

## ESLint

The way that you use presets in ESLint is by extending the packages in your config file.

If I want to use [`eslint-config-berkekaragoz`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-berkekaragoz) and add my preferred settings on top of that, I would have to do [this](https://eslint.org/docs/2.0.0/developer-guide/shareable-configs#using-a-shareable-config):

```yaml
# .eslintrc.yml
extends:
   - berkekaragoz
```

##### But where does the actual name come from?

Short answer, NPM package name.

There are certain [naming recommendations for ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs#using-a-shareable-config) configs. Either start with `eslint-config-` or `@SCOPE/eslint-config`.

So in the example above, you can either extend with `berkekaragoz` or `eslint-config-berkekaragoz` strings.

These will resolve to the config exported from `index.js`. If you want to export multiple configs, lets say `react`, you would export the settings from `react.js`. That will be usable by extending the `berkekaragoz/react`.

### Making Shareable ESLint config

There are 3 types of configuration types in ESLint:

-  JSON
-  YAML
-  JavaScript Object

To make your shareable config, you have to export it as a JavaScript object.

A simple one would look like this:

```js
// index.js
module.exports = {
   rules: { eqeqeq: "error" }, // do not allow '=='
}
```

You can see [the list of ESLint rules here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

## Our Monorepo

You can export all of your config in one package. But since we want to export multiple packages, we are making a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) structure. This way the versions of the configs are clearer. And, this is a good sample to learn publishing. The project is simple, but you still have to do the same publishing steps such as a complex project.

I make the monorepo package name as a [scoped module]("@berkekaragoz/eslint-config"): `@berkekaragoz/eslint-config`.

This structure is going to be:

```
packages/ # all have index.js and package.json + additional exports
    all/ # could be just consisting from 'extends' statements
    formatting/
    suggestions/
    react/
    typescript/
package.json
```

All of those packages name except `all` is directly suffixed to `eslint-config-berkekaragoz-`.

The directory named `all`'s package name is: `eslint-config-berkekaragoz`.

Assuming the ESLint configs has been made, it is time to configure `package.json`'s.

### Workspaces

We have 5 packages in our sample. Well, actually 6 including our monorepo, but thats not going to be published.

Now, in the `@berkekaragoz/eslint-config`'s package.json, we are going to set up the [workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

But why? For example, we want to use `formatting` package inside `all` package, so it is a dependency. Our packages are in the same repository, but we are not going to export all of our monorepo 5 times. That means, we have to use NPM dependencies.

We could specify the file paths to the `package.json`'s to use those dependencies. But there would be more work when publishing since relative paths shouldn't be used.

This is where workspaces come handy:

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "eslint-config-berkekaragoz-formatting": "workspace:*"
   }
}
```

This is a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) feature. After you create a workspace, it uses the package inside the monorepo. And when you publish the package, it automatically [replaces the versions](https://pnpm.io/workspaces#publishing-workspace-packages) with npm repository versions.

So lets setup the workspace by configuring the monorepo (`@berkekaragoz/eslint-config`) `package.json`:

```json
{
   "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

And use `pnpm i`. If you never used pnpm, you will notice that it installs very fast. It [leverages symlinks](https://pnpm.io/motivation) to avoid duplication.

## Publishing

Publishing is very simple at this point. You have to be registered to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), or the repository you are going to publish to.

Run `pnpm publish` in the directory of your package to publish it. Or you can use `pnpm -r publish` in the root directory of the monorepo.

My package: [npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-berkekaragoz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-berkekaragoz)

### Dealing with Problems

When I was publishing my own packages, I ran into some problems with workspace. The publish command, did not replace `workspace:*` versions with the proper ones while publishing. This was on version `7.0.0-rc.8`.

You can examine packages by using the `pnpm view` command, same as npm. So did I.

Expected behavior:
`pnpm view eslint-config-berkekaragoz@0.1.8`:

Actual behavior:
`pnpm view eslint-config-berkekaragoz@0.1.7`:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34271483/165362361-f803bbcc-f497-49dd-81dc-896a40dc99c5.png)

I joined pnpm's Discord server: [r.pnpm.io/chat](https://r.pnpm.io/chat). Turns out there already was an issue related to that. And, they patched this problem in less than 24 hours in version `7.0.0-rc.9`.

#### Testing

Before publishing, especially if it affects production grade software, you should test the package out. You should use the pack command to get a tarball, and use that as a dependency first. Then you can publish that tarball.

Funny thing is, I actually did that. I packed with `pnpm` and published with `npm` (because I knew about the problem). But I left the tarball where it is generated, inside the package. When I published it specifiying the path of the tarball, it made a new tarball and published it. Also not replacing the `workspace:*`.

You can run into these problems, but you should know the ways to deal with them.

### End

Thanks for reading. This has became longer than I imagined. I would love to hear your feedback. You can even leave it as [an issue in the monorepo](https://github.com/BerkeKaragoz/eslint-config/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=) that we used as a sample.
