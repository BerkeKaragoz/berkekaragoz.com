## Windows

Open Git Bash and follow.

1. **Generate SSH Keys:**
   If you don't already have SSH keys, you can generate them using Git Bash.

   cd ~/.ssh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "example@berkekaragoz.com"

   Run the following command in Git Bash to start the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

   Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/name_of_the_key
   ```

4. **Copy Public Key:**
   Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard:

   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/name_of_the_key.pub
   ```

5. **Add Public Key to GitLab:**
   Log in to your GitLab account. Go to "Settings" > "SSH Keys." Add the copied key and save it.
