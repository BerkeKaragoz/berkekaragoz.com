## Introduction

By the end of this guide, you will have a project that you can customize its inner workings anytime. Even if you don't want to customize it, you will learn how does the module bundling work in action.

What could this bring to you?

- You won't have to eject to customize your bundling
- You can make your features such as making the routing similar to Next.js
- Broader debugging opportunities

Final project repository on GitHub: [BerkeKaragoz/berkekaragoz-webpack-post](https://github.com/BerkeKaragoz/berkekaragoz-webpack-post)

## Preparing the Initial Project

We create a default npm project in our folder: `npm init -y`

We will have a `package.json` file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "berkekaragoz-webpack-scss",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js", "comment": "<-delete the main"
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

We are deleting the `main` entry since webpack is going to tell that.

Now we will create the other project files according to the following tree:

```
dist/
node_modules/ //already created
src/
 ├───index.css
 ├───index.html
 ├───index.js
 └───sample.jpg // or any image
```

_You can fill them as you wish, here are the contents of what I did._

`index.css`:

```css
html {
  background-color: #333;
  color: aliceblue;
}
```

`index.html`, create one with the emmet snippet `!`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

`index.js`:

```js
console.log("I didn't watch Star Wars.");
```

`sample.jpg`: [A link of my recent photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BerkeKaragoz/berkekaragoz-webpack-post/master/public/sample.jpg)

## Configuring webpack For the Initial Project

Install webpack and its CLI as a dev dependency:
`npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`

Create the `webpack.config.js` under the root of the project folder. And don't forget to read the comments.

```js
const path = require("path");

ENTRY_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "src/index");
DIST_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "dist");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development", // or production
  entry: {
    // remember that we deleted the main in package.json
    // this is where the project starts
    main: ENTRY_PATH,
  },
  output: {
    // this is where the bundled packages go
    path: DIST_PATH,
    // [name] is the name of the file and
    // [contenthash] is the hash of the bundle
    filename: "[name].[contenthash].js",
    clean: true, // remove existing previous bundles
  },
  //later
  module: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

Add the `build` command to the `package.json` under `scripts`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "...",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
```

Run the `build` command: `npm run build`

And you will see that your code will be bundled under the `dist/` folder: `main.7487bec281371ef08592.js`

You can run this with node: `node ./dist/main.7487bec281371ef08592.js`

The output: `I didn't watch Star Wars.`

This means that it works perfectly for what we have configured. It only bundles the JS at this time.

## HTML, CSS and JS Together

Now we have to bundle HTML and CSS with that.

### HTML

Install `html-webpack-plugin` to help us bundle HTML:
`npm i -D html-webpack-plugin`

Import the plugin in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
// const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

//... under module.exports
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      filename: "index.html", // output
      // the one which we have created
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
    }),
  ],
```

Ensure that your project works by building it. When you open the bundled `dist/index.html` and open the console, you will see the JS output in there.

### CSS

Now we have to setup **loaders**. These loaders import the assets such as `CSS`, `SCSS` as well as **images** and others things like `TS`. Those come in handy when dealing with parsing/compilation situations.

We will install two loaders: `npm i -D style-loader css-loader`

The `css-loader` will get the CSS file and passes it to the JS file. The `style-loader` will get the CSS file from the JS file and will pass that to the HTML.

We will set those up in the `module` in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
module: {
  rules: [{ test: /\.css$/, use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"] }], // have to be inorder
},
```

Import the CSS file to `index.js`:

```js
import "./index.css";
//console.log("I didn't watch Star Wars.");
```

And when you build and open the bundled HTML file, you will see that the background will be gray (`#333`). This means that the setup is successful.

### Assets

Now we will add resources such as images. For this, we need to add another rule in the `webpack.config.js`:

```js
rules: [
//...
  { test: /\.(jpg|jpeg|png|svg|ico|webp|gif)$/, type: "asset/resource" },
]
// And if you want to provide a name template
// add the following under the `output`:
  assetModuleFilename: "[name]-[contenthash][ext]",
```

We will test this later on, but it's probably okay. This is for using assets directly in our code.

Most of the time you will be using your `public/` folder to access resources. This way, you will be able to switch to a CDN in production.

We make a `public/` folder and copy its contents into the build folder `dist/`.
To do this we will install a copying plugin: `npm i -D copy-webpack-plugin`

The configuration is pretty straightforward, `webpack.config.js`:

```js
const CopyPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");
// Create the path of the static folder as public
PUBLIC_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname, "public");
// Under module.exports:
  plugins: [ //...
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [{ from: PUBLIC_PATH, to: DIST_PATH }],
    }),
  ],
```

Now if you put the `sample.jpg` into the `public/` folder, you will be able to access it with the `/sample.jpg` url. You will see the image in the `dist/` if you build your application.

## Configuring webpack for Development

Now we are successfully bundling our code. We have to make the development easier. In the end, we wouldn't want to build every time we want to test our code.

We will install the development server: `npm i -D webpack-dev-server`

Add the script to run the server to the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack serve --open",
    "build": "..."
  }
}
```

The `--open` option is if you want to open your default browser when the server is ready to serve.

With this, we will be accessing our project from the **memory** instead of the disk.

Now we can configure more options in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
  plugins: [
    //...
  ],
  devtool: "inline-source-map", //for tracing
  devServer: {
    // so that it can watch for other changes
    static: DIST_PATH,
    hot: true, // hot reload, save to refresh
  },
```

Notice the `devtool`, that is how we can know where the bundles come from. This way we can trace and debug possible errors or bugs.

Now you can run `npm run dev` to develop properly.

## Setup TypeScript

First, we install TypeScript and its loader: `npm i -D typescipt ts-loader`

Create the `tsconfig.json` file:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "es6",
    "target": "es5",
    "jsx": "react",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    // generate default imports if they don't exist
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  // our project shouldn't touch these
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.test.ts"],
  // look only for the following
  "include": ["src", "index.d.ts"]
}
```

Configure `ts-loader` in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
  rules: [ //...
    {
      test: /\.tsx?$/,
      use: 'ts-loader',
      exclude: /node_modules/,
    },
  ],
  //...
  module: {/*...*/},
  resolve: { // works like autocomplete for imports
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
```

Change `src/index.js` to `src/index.ts` and test it out:

```ts
import "./index.css";

let myVar: number;
myVar = 1;
console.log("myVar is", myVar);
```

You should see the output.

There is one more step to complete the TS setup. The resources will not work anymore in our code. Because we have to declare modules for them. Let's do that after configuring React so that we can see that in action.

### Configuring React

Let's get into rendering components with React. You can also use a different library.

Install React: `npm i react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom`

Firstly, let's create our component at `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
//import sampleImg from "./sample.jpg";
import "./index.scss";

export const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>BerkeKaragoz webpack Post</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now we have to render it somehow. But React requires a div to start on. So we modify our `src/index.html` file:

```html
<body>
  <!-- div#__react -->
  <div id="__react"></div>
</body>
```

We will select that `div` with its id and mount the `App.tsx` to it in `index.ts`:

```ts
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById("__react"));
```

Notice that you cannot call the App with JSX notation. Because `index` file has `.ts` extension instead of `.tsx`. You can configure that on your own if you want to. But for this article, I will continue.

When you run your app, you will see the heading in the document with the proper colors in the `index.css` file.

### Assets, again

Now while you can access the resources under `public/` folder, you will get an error if you try to import your asset to your code directly. That happens because we have to declare them as modules for TypeScript at the root as `index.d.ts`:

```ts
declare module "*.jpg";
declare module "*.jpeg";
declare module "*.png";
declare module "*.svg";
declare module "*.ico";
declare module "*.webp";
declare module "*.gif";
```

Remember that we had included this file in `tsconfig.json` before. That's how it gets into our project.

Test it out in `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import sampleImg from "./sample.jpg";
//...
  <img src={"/sample.jpg"} alt="sample" />
  <img src={sampleImg} alt="sample" />
```

Now both of the images should be in your document. If it works and your IDE shows an error, restart it.

## Configuring SASS

First, we install SASS and its loader like we did before. Since SASS works like TS, it compiles its files to CSS, we will also install them as dev dependencies: `npm i -D sass sass-loader`

Setup the loader process in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
  rules: [ //...
    {
      test: /\.s[ac]ss$/,
      use: ["style-loader", "css-loader", "sass-loader"],
    },
  ],
```

As I have explained, `sass-loader` passes its output to the `css-loader`. The rest is the same with CSS.

And since they are also seen as resources, we have to declare them as modules too in `index.d.ts`:

```ts
//...
declare module "*.scss";
declare module "*.sass";
```

We can test it out with a normal file, but let's use CS modules. Lets create `App.module.scss`:

```scss
$maxWidth: 512px;

.image {
  max-width: $maxWidth;
  height: $maxWidth * 0.5;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

And apply the class to our images in `App.tsx`:

```jsx
import style from "./App.module.scss";
//...
<img src={"/sample.jpg"} alt="sample" className={style.image} />
<img src={sampleImg} alt="sample" className={style.image} />
```

You will see that the images will be resized.

## Final

Now you have built a project from scratch with **webpack** that you can use **TypeScript** and **SCSS** in it!

### Where to?

You should optimize this process by making use of [caching](https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/) and [optimization options](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/).
