            Hi, my name is Berke. I was born in Istanbul. My interest in
            computer technology has been there since I was a kid. That led me to
            discover designing opportunities. Starting from gaming forums to
            designing graphics for various reasons. I have started to learn
            about software development just before I matriculated to Bilkent
            University{" "}
            <HeartIcon className="inline-block h-5 text-red-600 align-text-top" />
            .
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 indent-xs">
            Since then, I have been learning about multiple fields of software
            development. Focusing on front-end development abled me to utilize
            my graphic design skills with programming.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 indent-xs">
            As for the hobbies, competitive gaming is one of my biggest one. I
            play the chess of FPS, Quake, actively. In addition to this, I had
            been playing Counter-Strike and more others. After, I have been
            working as a tournament manager.
